## 2. Bootstrap
Is a CSS framework(most widely used), predesigned libraries that you can include into your code.

Pros: 
* easy and fast to use
* high browser compatibility 

Cons:
* We add everything to classes and makes things look messy and not css like. 
* low customizations. 

How to use:
* Include via a CDN link from [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com) at the end of header section
* Include via a CDN script from [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com) at the end of body section

12 column flexbox design, that uses flexbox(in the background) to create grid-like websites [example](./bootstrap/example1/index.html). Show sizes, media functionality, and margin. <br><br>
Go through [Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/) for more examples.

You can also visit the documentation and play around with what you can implement. [example2](./bootstrap/example1/index2.html)


## 3. Notes
* Homework: Install node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), create a company and use bootstrap to create a website for that company. Be creative!
