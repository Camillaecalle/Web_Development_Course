## 2. Including Javascript with HTML 
Three method for adding javascript(same as CSS):
* Inline 
* Internal
* External

See example  [ex.](./examples/adding_javascript.html) <br><br>
One thing to note is that you should always add javascript as close to the end(as possible) of the script. 


## Javascript and the Document Object Model
Javascript uses the document object model to interact with the html file that includes it.
