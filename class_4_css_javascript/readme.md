## 2. Flexbox
Our second example for website responsiveness is flexbox.Flexbox provides a predefined layout for your webpage.  One way to think of flexbox is that it makes the boxes from the box-model flexible(we will see in example). Flexbox is easy to use, and is great for websites that have a 1-row or 1-column like structure. It is easy to resize boxes, and place them around the screen(especially to center!). Flexbox is less trivial when you have to structure your webpage like a grid(several rows and columns), and though possible the "display: Grid" functionality is a better alternative for these cases.
See [Example](./flexbox/index.html)
