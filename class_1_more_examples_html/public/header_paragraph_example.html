    <p>
        What were the chances?
        <br/>
        It would have to be a lot more than 100 to 1. It
        was likely even more than 1,000 to 1. 
        <hr/>
        The more he thought about it, the
        odds of it happening had to be more than 10,000 to 1 and even 100,000 to 1.
        People often threw around the chances of something happening as being
        1,000,000 to 1 as an exaggeration of an unlikely event, but he could see
        that they may actually be accurate in this situation. Whatever the odds 
        of it happening, he knew they were big.
        <hr/><!-- void element-->
        What he didn't know was whether 
        this happening was lucky or unlucky.
